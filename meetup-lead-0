First need to send the overview to publish on meetup.com to @jwinfield
Then, I need to flesh out the outline - I think I will do some reading and research to fortify my thoughts.
Then make some slides with pictures and big bullets, and the final resources slide last.
Perhaps start an IPFS resources or a distrisys resources or something.
oh, then I need a quick demo - some ideas:
- simple live do the demo on the ipfs getting started as a demo - so people can see how easy it is to get up and running to start playing around with it.
- perhaps a fancy and/or audience participation demo, where we can get the room to install, and do some type of powwwow activity that engages all and some cool property of IPFS/location addressing / distributed internet emerges.
ok, so the part for Jim Winfield....
